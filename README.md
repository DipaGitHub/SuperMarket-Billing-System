# SuperMarket-Billing-System

Super market billing system is based on the concept to generate the bill reports and to add or delete items and update their details. The whole concept is designed via c++ language.

This super market billing system is a simple console application built in C++ without the use of graphics. This project will helped me understand basically two things â€“ use of stream class and file handling in c++ programming language. The project is simple to understand, and the source code has been presented in an understandable manner.
